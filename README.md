SabiCube
========

A single-player total conversion of Cube2-Sauerbraten with focus on adding rpg/adventure elements.
This package includes the first three levels of the game ZetaProject, and a test-map for the new features.
The goal is to make the gamebuilding process as fun as playing a game, with intuitive menus and guides to help anyone make their own open-source rpg/adventure game, without prior knowledge of programming or 3D-modeling.
This is a work in progress so editor-workflow might change in future releases as we add features to the engine, but maps from the original sauerbraten (or compatible engines) will be able to load with minor adjustment, and we have no plans to change the map-format.
SabiCube is tested on 64-bit (Kubuntu) and 32-bit (KXStudio), and we have provided a binary for both, so it should work, if you are lucky, If not... please follow the installguide.
