--------------------
A set of weathered industrial/grunge textures, mostly 512 with normal, bump, and specular maps.
Please note that the specular maps and some of the normalmaps for these textures are completely untested, and may look rather suboptimal.

bump(offset) maps are in the alpha channel of the *_nm normalmaps. Speculars are in *_s. If anyone converts these to fit other
standards, let me know and I'll mirror the alternate packs on my website.

----------------

The pack was inspired partly by Yan 'Method' Ostretsov's texture work, as well as by the photos from Opacity.us.
Many thanks to both :)

Some source material is borrowed from cgtextures.com. Specifically, the kitchen and kitchen1.tga files. Also, cheers, to keres for providing the wood base texture for those two textures.

if it makes my work more useful. However, please note that I am not interested in GPL'ing this pack, so don't bother asking.
