So you want to build a game?

Use F1 to enter edit-mode

if you hold down G and use your scroll-wheel, you'll notice that the selection tool gets bigger when you scroll up and smaler when you scroll down

left-click on the ground and use your scrollwheel to elevate or lower the selected.

if you want to select a bigger area, you can either use a bigger selection-tool, or left-click and then right-click to add to your selection.

Try elevating a place on the map, then select the cube you have created and click F2 to select a texture.

If yiou dont want your map to be all cubes, you can either use the heightmap (click h and use your scrollwheel to elevate or lower), or you can edit the cubes by holding down Q and using your scrollwheel to lower the edges of a selected cube.
Please note that using heightmap can cause other areas of the the map to deform, so use with caution, and if you want to undo you just click U.

To place a mapmodel, light, monster, pickup-able-item or npc, just click ESC and choose SabiCube

If you want to add more textures to your map you can edit the yourmapname.cfg located in /packages/base/. I'm planning to make packages of related textures and models to choose from in the SabiCube menu, you can try the texturepacks i the menu, but it wont be persistent atm.

If you place a consumable item, the player can pick it up and it will show up in the player-inventory, no need to script anything, you just place an item and use F1 to exit and enter editmode.

If you want o have dialogs, you can't avoid scripting, but dont be alarmed by the concept, it's actually pretty easy.
Have a look at the example below, its a simple script for an npc with the mapmodel number 166:

// called whenever the mapmodel 166 is activated (player click item)
item_activate_166 = [
	// what to do, in this case show a gui called HiThere (remember casesensetive)
    showgui HiThere
]

// create the gui HiThere
newgui HiThere [
    // npc says Hi there
    guitext "Hi there"
    guibar
    // button with text "Hi", action [closegui] does excatly what you would expect ;)
    guibutton "Hi" [closegui]
    // button with text "Who are you", action [showgui blabla] opens a new gui
    guibutton "Who are you" [showgui blabla]
]

// create the gui blabla
newgui blabla [
    // npc says "My name is Mud"
    guitext "My name is Mud"
    guibar
    // button with text "Ok", action [closegui] does excatly what you would expect ;)
    guibutton "Ok" [closegui]
]
